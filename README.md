Nodify
======

Nodify is a web-based IDE for creating and testing JavaScript programs on
NodeJS. You can already edit and save your programming projects, using the
on-screen Bespin editor that provides syntax highlighting and natural keyboard
shortcuts. Executing your project is performed by clicking 'Execute'. After the
execution is finished, the console will be displayed containing the program's
output. If the program is a server or enters an infinite loop, you can terminate
its execution by clicking 'Terminate'. Currently projects are single-file, but
soon you will be able to have multiple files per project. You may create
multiple projects, rename or delete them using the links on top of the screen.
You don't need to create an account to use Nodify, a unique user account is
created and stored in a cookie in your browser. Currently, if you browse the
service from a different browser you will create a new user account.
